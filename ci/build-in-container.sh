# Build inside a Devuan excalibur container, for .github/workflows/build-repo.yml
# (docker run ... devuan/devuan:excalibur /work/ci/build-in-container.sh):
# as root, set up a build user like the build machine's (owning the workspace,
# passwordless sudo), then as that user:
#   - prepare-build.sh: clone the repositories, install the build tools and
#     dependencies, set up repo/ (holding the last release's packages, if
#     restored) and fetch Proxmox's unchanged packages
#   - select-steps.sh: what to build (STEPS: auto, all, or step names)
#   - build.sh --only <steps>, then record them in repo/SOURCES
#   - package-repo.sh --prune: drop the older package versions
# Results for the workflow in build/ci/: steps (built, comma-separated) and
# changed (true if the repository's index changed).
#
# Environment: STEPS (default auto), BUILD_UID (the workspace owner's UID),
# GITHUB_ACTIONS (for annotations). The workspace is /work.
