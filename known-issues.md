# Known issues: PVE on Devuan (OpenRC) on nb-devuan

State after installing pve-manager 9.2.21 with the `pkg.*.lsbservice` builds
on 2026-10-02. Details on the packages and commits are in
`pve-manager/devuan-dependencies.md`.

## watchdog-mux holds the hardware watchdog

pve-ha-manager (pulled in as a pve-manager dependency) starts `watchdog-mux`,
which opens `/dev/watchdog`, here the laptop's hardware watchdog (`iTCO_wdt`).
If the process is killed without a clean stop (e.g. `kill -9`, OOM), the
watchdog isn't disarmed and the **machine resets**. Stop it only with
`rc-service watchdog-mux stop`.

## "Unable to open syslog" on every PVE command and daemon start (fixed)

`proxmox-log` (Rust, in libpve-rs-perl) tried only the journald socket and,
without it, printed `Unable to open syslog: Os { code: 2, … }` and logged
to stderr, which is lost for daemons.

**Fixed** on 2026-10-02 (proxmox-rs `4b8d3d2d`): without journald it now
logs to syslog (`/dev/log`, facility daemon, identifier = program name).
libpve-rs-perl was rebuilt and installed; the message is gone, and Rust log
messages end up in `/var/log/syslog`.

## Package removals today not caused by the PVE install

- `firmware-iwlwifi` was removed at 15:44 by `apt install proxmox-default-kernel`:
  `pve-firmware` replaces it (and contains the iwlwifi firmware).
- `exim4` was removed at 15:50 by `apt install postfix open-iscsi chrony`:
  postfix replaces it.

## /etc/hosts changed

pmxcfs (pve-cluster) needs the hostname to resolve to a non-loopback
address, so the `127.0.1.1 nb-devuan …` line was changed to `192.168.2.14`.
If the laptop gets a different address, pve-cluster won't start until this is
updated. Backup of the original: `/etc/hosts.before-pve`.

## Packages replaced by the install

- `ifupdown` → `ifupdown2` (our build 3.3.0-1+pmx12, from `ifupdown2`
  with a new `networking` init script; Devuan's ifupdown2 has none, so nothing
  would bring the network up at boot).
- Devuan's `lxc`/`liblxc` → `lxc-pve`. Devuan's `lxc` is still in state `rc`
  (config files kept). Its `/etc/init.d/lxc` and `lxc-net` were left with
  mode 644 after lxc-pve took them over and had to be made executable again;
  a fresh install isn't affected.

## /etc/machine-id was missing: subscription server ID from the SSH host key

On Debian, systemd creates `/etc/machine-id`; on Devuan nothing does (dbus
keeps its own `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id`). The subscription server ID is
computed in libpve-rs-perl (`proxmox-subscription`) via libsystemd's
`sd_id128_get_machine_app_specific()`, which needs that file. It fails
silently and falls back to the MD5 of the SSH host key:
`pvesubscription get` reports `serverid: F9F8C5B958E5D8DE380C43FB85E6BD04`
(candidate `SSH MD5`). Nothing breaks, but regenerating the SSH host keys
changes the server ID, which would invalidate a subscription key.

**Worked around on this machine** on 2026-10-02 with
`sudo dbus-uuidgen --ensure=/etc/machine-id`. The server ID is now
`E4BF5E38F46B4461BE66249CAF70483C` (candidate `machine-id`, listed first),
with `SSH MD5` as the second candidate. pve-manager's local check
(`PVE/API2/Subscription.pm`) accepts a stored server ID matching any
candidate; whether Proxmox's subscription server does is unverified.

That command generated a new ID instead of reusing dbus's: `/etc/machine-id`
(`02dcf159…`) and `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id` (`0b80f3dc…`) differ, while on
systemd systems the latter is a symlink to the former. Harmless for PVE, but
the planned fix reuses dbus's ID.

**Fixed** for new installations: pve-common's lsbservice build now ships a
`pve-machine-id` init script (pve-common `1865f24`). It creates the file at
boot and on installation if it's missing, reusing D-Bus's ID, and never
changes an existing one. Installed here; this machine keeps its hand-made ID,
so the mismatch with D-Bus's ID remains.

## APT repositories view fails: Devuan's codename isn't recognized

`pvesh get /nodes/<node>/apt/repositories` (GUI: Node → Repositories) fails
with `proxmox-apt error - unknown Debian code name 'excalibur'`. Adding a
standard repository via the API fails the same way.

The cause is in proxmox-rs: `proxmox-apt`'s `get_current_release_codename()`
reads `VERSION_CODENAME` from `/etc/os-release`, and `DebianCodename` only
knows Debian's codenames. The package list (`/apt/versions`) and updates
(`apt-get update` via `pveupdate`) work. **Fixed** in proxmox-rs (branch `feature/init-systems-refactoring`,
`5bb1c086`..`6337ef1a`) and **deployed** on 2026-10-02: libpve-rs-perl
0.15.3 was rebuilt against the local proxmox-rs checkout and installed. The
repositories API now lists all files without errors, with origin "Devuan"
for the Devuan sources.

## Enterprise repository was enabled without subscription

pve-manager ships `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.sources` (enabled),
as on any PVE installation. Without a subscription key, `apt-get update`
fails for it with `401 Unauthorized`. The system's apt has none of the
private fetch configuration's pins, so enabling a working Proxmox repository
at system level (e.g. no-subscription) could replace the lsbservice builds
with Proxmox's and pull in Proxmox's systemd packages. Keep Proxmox's
repositories out of the system's apt.

**Done** on 2026-10-02: `Enabled: no` added to the file, so `apt-get update`
runs without errors and the repositories API reports it as disabled. The
original is in `/var/backups/pve-enterprise.sources.before-disable`. The file
is a conffile of pve-manager, so upgrades keep the change and only ask if
the packaged version changes.

## apt reports "Permission denied" for the local repository

`apt-get update` prints `Err: file:/home/saki/proxmox/repo ./ Packages …
Permission denied`, because apt's `_apt` sandbox user can't enter
`/home/saki` (mode 700). apt then reads it as root (`Get: … Packages`), so
the index is loaded. Cosmetic; moving the repository out of the home
directory (e.g. `/srv/pve-devuan-repo`) would avoid it.

## Node status "unknown" (1): Devuan's default corosync.conf

Devuan's (Debian's) corosync package ships a working
`/etc/corosync/corosync.conf` (cluster `debian`, single node `node1` at
127.0.0.1), and its init script starts corosync at boot. Proxmox's corosync
build ships that file only as an example in `/usr/share/doc`.

When pve-cluster was installed, pmxcfs found the file, started in cluster
mode and imported it as `/etc/pve/corosync.conf`. `nb-devuan` wasn't a member
of that "cluster", so `/cluster/resources` reported its status as `unknown`
and `/cluster/status` showed cluster `debian` with `node1`.

**Fixed** on 2026-10-02:
- stopped pve-cluster and corosync
- started `pmxcfs -l` (local mode)
- moved `/etc/pve/corosync.conf` and `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf` to
  `/var/backups/{pve-,}corosync.conf.devuan-default`
- restarted pve-cluster
- `update-rc.d corosync disable`

`/cluster/status` now shows the standalone node `nb-devuan`, online. dpkg
keeps the deleted conffile deleted on upgrades.

**Note:** with corosync disabled, `pvecm create` starts corosync but
doesn't enable it at boot; run `update-rc.d corosync enable` afterwards,
until Proxmox's corosync build replaces Devuan's (`openrc-devuan.md`,
Part A, corosync-pve).

## Node status "unknown" (2): pvestatd hangs on the QEMU CPU flag query

pve-qemu-kvm's patch `0030-PVE-redirect-stderr-to-journal-when-daemonized`
makes a daemonized QEMU send its stderr to the journal via
`sd_journal_stream_fd()`. Without journald that returns an error, the result
isn't checked, and `dup2()` fails, so the daemonized QEMU keeps the caller's
stderr open.

- **pvestatd:** it runs such a QEMU at startup to query the supported CPU
  flags (`query_supported_cpu_flags`, VM id `-1`, once with TCG and once
  with KVM), and `run_command` waits forever for the pipe to close. So
  pvestatd sent no status at all, and the node stayed `unknown` even after
  the corosync fix. Reproduced without PVE: `kvm … -daemonize 2>&1 | cat`
  never returns.
- **VM starts:** `qm start`/`vm_start` start QEMU the same way and would
  have hung too.

**Workaround** (temporary): kill the query QEMU (`kill $(cat
/var/run/qemu-server/-1.pid)`). pvestatd then continues and reports the
node `online`, but the query failed, so it retries after 120 seconds and
hangs again.

**Fixed** on 2026-10-02: pve-qemu-kvm `11.0.3-4+devuan1` (pve-qemu
`d0d9eab`) falls back to syslog when there's no journald, so a daemonized
QEMU's messages end up in `/var/log/syslog` as `QEMU[<pid>]`. Installed;
pvestatd's CPU flag query completes and the node stays online, and VM 100
starts through the API.

## VM start via the API failed: "Insecure dependency in rmdir"

`TASK ERROR: Insecure dependency in rmdir while running with -T switch at
/usr/share/perl5/PVE/InitSystem/LSBService.pm line 616`, on starting a VM
from the GUI/API after it had run before.

- **Cause:** pvedaemon runs with taint checks (`perl -T`), and the
  LSBService backend removed the VM's leftover empty scope through a path
  found via `glob()`, which is tainted. systemd removes empty transient
  scopes itself; here it's done on the next start.
- **Same problem:** in `stop_scope` (PIDs read from `cgroup.procs`) and for
  template instance markers. Tests with `qm` (no `-T`) didn't show it.

**Fixed** on 2026-10-02 (pve-common `7fbdbc2`, with a test running under
`perl -T`): installed, and VM 100 started, stopped and started again
through the HTTPS API.

## ifupdown2 deconfigured the network at every shutdown

`/usr/share/ifupdown2/sbin/start-networking stop` (run by the `networking`
init script) detected a shutdown/reboot with `systemctl list-jobs`, to keep
the interfaces configured then (`SKIP_DOWN_AT_SYSRESET=yes`). Without
systemd that always failed.

A local edit of the installed script (`rc-status --runlevel` and
`pgrep -f …`) missed reboots and could match unrelated processes; it's saved
in `/var/backups/start-networking.local-fix`.

**Fixed** on 2026-10-03 (ifupdown2 `24b1e04`, `3.3.0-1+pmx12+devuan1`): the
runlevel decides (0/6), or OpenRC's `RC_RUNLEVEL`. The installed package
replaced the local edit. Not yet verified with a real reboot.

## Package upgrades failed: init scripts' start on a running daemon

Upgrading pve-firewall failed in its maintainer script:
`invoke-rc.d pve-firewall start` returned an error, because the daemon's own
`start` refuses to run twice ("can't acquire lock ... daemon already
started"). pve-manager, qemu-server, pve-container and pve-ha-manager then
stayed unconfigured. The same applied to pvedaemon, pveproxy, spiceproxy,
pvestatd, pvescheduler, pve-ha-crm and pve-ha-lrm; systemd never runs
`ExecStart=` for an active unit, so this didn't show there.

**Fixed** on 2026-10-03 (pve-manager `cf716c0b`, pve-firewall `6ef89ae`,
pve-ha-manager `21c88ba`, as `+devuan2`): `start` exits 0 if the pid file
names a running process. The half-configured packages were configured with
`dpkg --configure -a`; everything is `ii` again.

## Guests weren't started at boot: pve-guests' worker and the console

At boot, the pve-guests init script failed (pve2, `/var/log/boot`):

```
failed to tcsetpgrp: Inappropriate ioctl for device
got no worker upid - start worker failed
 * ERROR: pve-guests failed to start
```

`pvesh create /nodes/localhost/startall` runs a synchronous worker, and
pve-common's `fork_worker` gives the worker the terminal when stdin is one
(`setpgid` and `tcsetpgrp`, `RESTEnvironment.pm`). OpenRC runs init scripts
with the console as stdin, but it isn't their controlling terminal, so
`tcsetpgrp` fails with ENOTTY and the worker dies before reporting its task
ID. No guest marked `onboot` was started, and `stopall` at shutdown would
have failed the same way. pve-guests.service has stdin on `/dev/null`, so
this didn't show with systemd.

**Fixed** on 2026-10-07 (pve-manager `82f95a01`, as `+devuan3`): the init
script runs both `pvesh` calls with stdin from `/dev/null`. Not yet
verified with a reboot.

## ZFS pools aren't imported or mounted at boot

Proxmox's ZFS packages (`zfsutils-linux` 2.4.4-pve1 and its libraries,
from `zfsonlinux`, installed as dependencies of the storage stack) ship
only systemd units (`zfs-import-cache`, `zfs-import-scan`, `zfs-mount`,
`zfs-share`, `zfs-zed`, `zfs-import@`, …), no init scripts. Debian's own
packaging installs upstream OpenZFS's `/etc/init.d` scripts; Proxmox's
build creates them too, but lists `etc/init.d` in `debian/not-installed`.
Shipping them in an lsbservice profile would be the fix. So on Devuan nothing
imports or mounts ZFS pools at boot, and ZED doesn't run. ZFS is **out of
scope** for now (see below).

## Out of scope for now: Ceph and ZFS

The current scope is PVE without Ceph and without ZFS:

- **Ceph:** only the client libraries (librados2, librbd1, … 19.2 from
  Proxmox's ceph-squid repo) are installed, as dependencies of pve-qemu-kvm
  and the storage stack. Ceph's daemons ship only systemd units, and
  pve-manager's Ceph management (`PVE/Ceph/*`, `pveceph`,
  `pve-cephx-rotate-service-keys`) still calls `systemctl`.
- **ZFS:** the userland is installed as a dependency, but there's no boot
  integration (above). pve-storage only touches `zfs-import@` units if the
  init system has them (pve-storage `0a98c48`).

## Not tested yet

- VM and container start/stop/reboot
- HA
- SDN with DHCP (dnsmasq instances)
- directory storage creation (fstab mounts)
- a full reboot: boot order of all init scripts, network via ifupdown2,
  pmxcfs before the other daemons
